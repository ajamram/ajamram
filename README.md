### Hi Y'all 👋

## Antonio Amram (he/him)
I'm Antonio, a Senior at Northwestern University majoring in Statistics with minors in Data Science, Political Science, and Marketing.

### What I'm working on right now
I'm currently working on a shiny R dashboard for [picking and evaluating stock portfolios](https://github.com/ajamram/stock_app), which will be available at the link once it goes public.
I'm also working on updating a [movie revenue prediction model](https://github.com/ajamram/movies_2021), which should be up sometime soon. 

### What's to come
I'm planning on adding more work this year as I learn more Python and maybe even (fingers crossed 🤞) some Julia.
I have a notebook full of project ideas, and if you bear with me, this page will grow as I do!

### What I know
I'm very comfortable using R for every phase of data science, from data wrangling to modeling to communication/implementation.  I am well-versed in statistical theory and mathematical statistics, including Bayesian methods and survey sampling, which informs my analyses and model building. My background in Political Science and Integrated Marketing Communications gives me more tools to understand, process, and communicate the data that populates the world around us, and I look forward to sharing that curiosity with the world!

### And a little bit about me
My interests include:
- Finance 📈
- Sports (especially Soccer) ⚽
- Movies and pop culture 🎥
- Politics 🗳️
- and more!
